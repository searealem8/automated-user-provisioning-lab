# Automated User Provisioning Lab

This project simulates an IT Support onboarding process using Python and Bash scripts.

## Project Overview

- `add_users.py`: Python script reads `users.csv` and simulates creating user accounts.
- `users.csv`: Sample data with new employee information.
- `create_home_dirs.sh`: Bash script to simulate creating home directories for users.
- `welcome_email.md`: Template for welcome email to new hires.
- `ticket_002_user_setup.md`: Sample help desk ticket requesting new user setup.

## How to Use

1. Run `add_users.py` to simulate user account creation:
   ```bash
   python3 add_users.py

bash create_home_dirs.sh


---

### Here’s what you do:

- When you edit README.md, just paste the entire README content I sent you — all at once.  
- That includes item 2 with the Bash command wrapped inside triple backticks (```bash ... ```).  
- The triple backticks create a code block in markdown, which formats those lines as commands to run in the terminal.

---

**In short:**  
Paste all the text exactly as is into the README.md editor on GitHub, including the numbered steps and the code blocks inside the backticks.

3. Use `welcome_email.md` as a template for onboarding emails.
